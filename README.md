## Various algorithms and algorithms tasks from courses, etc. ##

Contains various stuff regarding to algorithms and data structures, also some tasks from courses, etc.

List of solutions:

1. MinCut problem, solved by randomized [Karger's algorithm] [1]
2. [Strongly connected component problem] [2]
3. Shortest path's from one vertex to all other ([Floyd-Warshall algo] [3])
4. Karatsuba fast multiplication (right now just skeleton in Haskell)
5. [Percolation] [4] problem
6. [Blocking] [7] and [NonBlocking] [8] queue (on hold)
7. [Discrete optimization course] [7]
8. [Machine learning course] [8]
